# Generating Schema Code

The code we used for `Books.version` was generated from our books API's schema.
It was generated by the
[`@dillonkearns/elm-graphql` NPM package](https://npmjs.com/package/@dillonkearns/elm-graphql).

## 🏃‍ Run the CLI

For this exercise, the code will not be compiling initially.

Do not touch `Main.elm` for this exercise. Instead, you
will be getting the code compiling just by running a command
in your terminal.
