# Making The First Query

Look at the query in the query explorer. This is what an
"empty" query looks like. You could make this query anywhere,
in any schema, and you would get the same thing.

## ?

- Why is the data returned different in the
  `elm-graphql` response and the `gql` response?

## Exercise

Before doing the exercise:

- What is the type of the `version` exercise?
- There is exactly one top-level value you can get without
  doing any nested selection sets. Which is it?
  Why do you need to nest selection sets for some,
  but not for this one?
- What do you expect to be the return type in your Elm code
  when you fetch this? Why?

Now, fetch the field described above.
