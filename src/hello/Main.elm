    Editor Checklist

See our {Link|editor setup guide| url = https://incrementalelm.com/learn/editor-config } for how to set up Atom with these features.

| List
    - You get code completion (example: type {Code|List.m} and you should see {Code|List.map} as a suggestion).
    - Inline Errors - try adding a top-level definition of {Code|foo = bar}. If you get an error in your editor, it makes it much easier to fix errors because you don't have to go back and forth."""
