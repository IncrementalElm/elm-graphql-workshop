# Elm GraphQL Workshop

## Set Up

Simply `cd` into the top-level workshop repository, and then run:

```
npm install
```

Then open the top-level `elm-graphql-workshop` directory in your editor of choice.

Try running this command and opening `localhost:8000` to ensure that everything is working:

```
./run.sh ./src/part01
```

The workshop instructions will be divided between the presentation and the exercises.
